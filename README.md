# How it Works

The user is asked to enter a value in meters through a dialog box. The entered value is stored in the value constant.
The user is then presented with a list of measurement units to which the value in meters can be converted. The unit of measurement selected by the user is stored in the result constant.
Based on the selected measurement unit, the switch control structure performs the appropriate conversion.
After conversion, an alert is displayed to the user showing the conversion result.
